# Call Center Project SQL

In this project we analyse a dataset we got from 'Real World Fake Data' using SQL then we visualize it using Power BI. 

The link to the dataset : [https://data.world/markbradbourne/rwfd-real-world-fake-data/workspace/file?filename=Call+Center.csv](https://data.world/markbradbourne/rwfd-real-world-fake-data/workspace/file?filename=Call+Center.csv)

note: They have awesome datasets ! so feel free to choose whatever dataset you want from it, I picked the call-center one.

Steps we did :

- Download the csv file.
- Import the file to MySQL
- Clean it a bit (since it's pretty clean to start with)
- Perform EDA
- Visualize it using Power BI.

Here is the visualization
